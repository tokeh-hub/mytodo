### Implementation
- This Project was built using javascript framework, React. I love using React because of its reusable hooks and the simplicity of breaking my entire codes into different reusable components.
- This project uses the mobile-first design method. CSS media queries are used to take care of the mobile version.
- For a cleaner application, i used CSS framework Bootstrap. 
- To add to the Todo list, you can either enter your activity/todo in the input box or click on the 'Add' button.
- To edit or update your todo, click on the edit icon,your former todo immediately appears in the input box enabling you to edit your todo and once you're done editing, you can    click on the 'Edit' button or press enter to add your updated todo.
- To delete, click on the trash button.
- I added a function that updates the number of things/activities on your todo list.
